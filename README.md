***How IMDb Platform Works ?***    

**1.User Ratings --** IMDb ratings are primarily based on the ratings submitted by registered users of the IMDb website or app. Users can rate movies on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. These ratings are aggregated to calculate the overall rating for each movie.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  **2.Weighted Average --** IMDb uses a weighted average formula to calculate the overall rating for a movie. The formula takes into account factors such as the number of ratings received and the distribution of those ratings.                                                                                                                                                                                           
**3.Ratings Distribution --** IMDb considers the distribution of ratings when calculating the overall rating for a movie. Movies with a more uniform distribution of ratings may receive a higher overall rating compared to movies with a more polarized distribution.                                                                                                                                 
**4.User Reviews --** In addition to numerical ratings, IMDb also allows users to submit written reviews and comments for movies. These user reviews can provide additional context and insight into the quality of a movie.                                                                                                                                                                                        
**5.Top Rated Lists --** IMDb also provides curated lists of top-rated movies based on user ratings.These lists highlight the highest-rated movies across various genres, decades, and other categories.
